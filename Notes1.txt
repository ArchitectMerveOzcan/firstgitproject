This is my first GitHUb Class
This is my second commit

GITHUB DAY 1:
FIRST CODE PUSH:
git init  ->>>> Create a .git folder in our computer
git add .  ->>>
git commit -m "first commit" ->>> Create a new version
git branch -M main ->>> Creating a new branch called main
git remote add origin YOURPROJECTLINK ->>> Connects Local Project(git) to Remote repository(github)
git push -u origin main
=========
SECOND CODE PUSH:
git add .
git commit -m "updating the code"
git push

GIT IGNORE:
WHAT?
.gitignore should be created at the project level
It is used to ignore/hide the files
The files in .gitignore will not be added and committed and pushed
-----------------------------------
Example:
create 3 files : Notes2.txt, Notes3.txt, Notes4.txt
And Create .gitignore file in the project level
Then put Notes3.txt path in .gitignore file
Then commit
Then push
Then Notes3.txt should not be pushed in GitHub
